    <h3>Technical Interview</h3>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="question">1. Explain the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java.</div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which can contain data in the form of fields, and code in the form of methods. Key principles include encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="question">2. What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface in Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>An abstract class can have both abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation), while an interface can only have abstract methods (prior to Java 8). Starting from Java 8, interfaces can have default and static methods.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="question">3. What are Java exceptions and how are they handled?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>Exceptions are events that disrupt the normal flow of the program. They are handled using try, catch, and finally blocks. Specific exceptions can be caught and handled in the catch block.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="question">4. What is the difference between == and .equals() in Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>== checks for reference equality, i.e., whether two references point to the same object. .equals() checks for value equality, i.e., whether two objects are logically equal.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="question">5. What is a constructor in Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>A constructor is a special method used to initialize objects. It is called when an object of a class is created. Constructors have the same name as the class and do not have a return type.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="question">6. Explain the concept of inheritance in Java.</div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>Inheritance is a mechanism where one class acquires the properties and behaviors (methods) of another class. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism and code reuse.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="question">7. What is the use of the 'final' keyword in Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>The 'final' keyword can be used with variables, methods, and classes. A final variable's value cannot be changed, a final method cannot be overridden, and a final class cannot be subclassed.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="question">8. What are threads in Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>Threads are lightweight processes that allow concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of CPU. Threads can be created by implementing the Runnable interface or extending the Thread class.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="question">9. What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList in Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>ArrayList uses a dynamic array to store elements and provides fast random access, while LinkedList uses a doubly linked list to store elements and provides faster insertion and deletion.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="question">10. Explain the concept of polymorphism in Java.</div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon. It is achieved through method overriding (runtime polymorphism) and method overloading (compile-time polymorphism).</p>
        </div>
    </div>
