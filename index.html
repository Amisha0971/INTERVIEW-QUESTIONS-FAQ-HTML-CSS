        <h2>Sample Interview Questions</h2>
        <div class="faq">
            <h3>Online Aptitude Test</h3>
            <p>Q1. What is the next number in the sequence: 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, ...?</p>
            <p>Q2. If 3x + 2 = 14, what is the value of x?</p>

            <h3>Technical Interview</h3>
            <p>Q1. Explain the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java.</p>
            <p>A1. OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which can contain data in the form of fields, and code in the form of methods. Key principles include encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.</p>

            <p>Q2. What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface in Java?</p>
            <p>A2. An abstract class can have both abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation), while an interface can only have abstract methods (prior to Java 8). Java 8 onwards, interfaces can have default and static methods.</p>

            <p>Q3. Write a Java program to reverse a string.</p>
            <p>A3. 
                <pre>
public class ReverseString {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String original = "Hello";
        String reversed = new StringBuilder(original).reverse().toString();
        System.out.println("Reversed string: " + reversed);
    }
}
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>Q4. How does Java handle memory management?</p>
            <p>A4. Java handles memory management through the use of an automatic garbage collector that deallocates memory for objects that are no longer referenced.</p>

            <p>Q5. What are the main differences between JDK, JRE, and JVM?</p>
            <p>A5. JDK (Java Development Kit) is used to develop Java applications and includes the JRE and development tools. JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is used to run Java applications and includes the JVM and standard libraries. JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is the engine that executes Java bytecode.</p>

            <p>Q6. Explain the use of the 'final' keyword in Java.</p>
            <p>A6. The 'final' keyword can be used to declare constants (variables that cannot be reassigned), prevent method overriding, and prevent inheritance by making a class final.</p>

            <p>Q7. What is exception handling in Java?</p>
            <p>A7. Exception handling in Java is a mechanism to handle runtime errors. It uses try, catch, finally blocks, and throws and throw keywords to manage exceptions.</p>

            <p>Q8. Describe the Java Collections Framework.</p>
            <p>A8. The Java Collections Framework provides a set of classes and interfaces for storing and manipulating groups of data as a single unit. It includes interfaces like List, Set, and Map, and classes like ArrayList, HashSet, and HashMap.</p>

            <p>Q9. What is multithreading in Java?</p>
            <p>A9. Multithreading is a Java feature that allows the execution of two or more threads concurrently. Threads are lightweight processes that share the same memory space, enabling parallel execution of code.</p>

            <p>Q10. What is the difference between '== operator' and '.equals()' method in Java?</p>
            <p>A10. The '==' operator compares references (memory addresses) to check if two objects are the same instance. The '.equals()' method is used to compare the actual content of objects for logical equality.</p>

            <h3>HR Interview</h3>
            <p>Q1. Tell me about yourself.</p>
            <p>Q2. Why do you want to work for Accenture?</p>
            <p>Q3. Describe a challenging situation you faced and how you dealt with it.</p>
